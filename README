The left-right positions of British MPs inferred from a survey of local councillors
===

This repository contains the R code and data necessary to replicate
the findings in the above note.

It does not contain the raw data, which could in principle enable
respondents to be identified.

The repository has the following directories:

 - R/
 - article/
 - data/
 - working/
 - output/
 - shiny_pairwise_mps/

The directory `R` contains eight R files, but of these the first six
are used to prepare the comparisons, generate the survey script used,
and tidy the raw responses. Researchers who wish to replicate the
results should concentrate on 007_model_both_waves.R and
008_prepare_both_waves_outputs.R.

The two outputs of the note are contained in `output/`; these are:

 - `summary_statistics_file.csv`: a spreadsheet with one row per MP,
   where MPs are identified by their wikidata identifier, their
   constituency and party over the 2019-2024 and 2024-
   parliaments. The positions are contained in columns `econ_mean`,
   `econ_lo`, and `econ_hi`, and `cult_mean`, `cult_lo`, and
   `cult_hi`; these are posterior means, the 5th percentile of the
   posterior distribution, and the 95th percentile of the posterior
   distribution
   
 - `mpsleftright_full.csv.gz`: a zipped CSV file with one row per
   MP-by-dimension-by-iteration combination. Rows with dimension equal
   to one refer to the MP's position on the economic dimension; rows
   with dimension equal to two refer to the MP's position on the
   cultural dimension.

The data/ folder contains some other files which are used in the
article, which is a Quarto markdown file which pulls in the outputs
and other data.
