The prior for the initial cutpoint $\tau^{\ast{}}_1$ is a normal
distribution with a mean of -2 and a standard deviation of one
half. What does this mean? It means that if the model is correct and
respondents respond based only on the differences between MPs'
positions, then the probability that MP A is described as much more
right-wing than MP B *when in fact* A and B have the same position is
low but not zero. Specifically, when we simulate from this
distribution, pass it through the cumulative logistic function and
calculate the average probability across many simulations, the
probability is around one in eight. An alternative prior with a more
negative mean or a smaller standard deviation would reduce this
probability further; an alternative prior with a larger (more
positive) mean or a larger standard deviation would increase this
probability further. A probability of one in eight allows for
respondents to hit the first option through error (encompassed by the
model) or through a systematic preference for the first response
option (not encompassed by the model).

Now consider the priors for the two spacing parameters $\delta_1$ and
$\delta_2$. These priors must be strictly positive if the thresholds
are to be ordered. We just suggested that the first cutpoint might
have an average value of -2. If responses are indeed symmetrical, then
this implies that the last cutpoint should have a value of +2. This in
turn implies that the expected value of $2 \cdot \delta_1 + \delta_2$
should be around four. If, for simplicity, we adopt the same prior for
$\delta_2$ as we do for $\delta_1$, then this suggests a prior of
$N^{+}(0, \sqrt{3})$, since the sum of three independent half-normal
distributions with standard deviations of $\sqrt{3}$ is close to four. 

Although in our description of the model we considered shifts over
time next, when discussing prior specificiations we find it more
helpful to consider party next. Our model relies on party fixed
effects relative to the reference party, the Conservatives. We adopt
the same prior for party effects on the economic and cultural
dimensions. This is a prior for a normal distribution with a mean of
zero and a standard deviation of 4. This prior has to be interpreted
in the light of the priors on the cut-offs. If the difference between
the first and last cutpoints is four units, then we should be open to
the possibility that party effects are as big as this
difference. Setting a standard deviation of four units assigns a
reasonably-large probability (~32%) to effects this large or greater.

Having considered party, we can now consider the prior on the
idiosyncratic legislator-specific elements of legislators' ideal
points, net of their parties. These are drawn from a bivariate normal
distribution with means of zero and an estimated covariance
matrix. Rather than place a prior on the covariance matrix directly,
we decompose the covariance matrix into the product of three
matrices and place priors on elements of these matrices. That is, if

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha^{Econ.} \\
\alpha^{Cult.}
\end{bmatrix} \sim
N\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 
\end{bmatrix},
\symbf{\Sigma}
\right)
$$

then:

$$
\symbf{\Sigma} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^{Econ.} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^{Cult.} 
\end{bmatrix}
\symbf{R}
\begin{bmatrix} 
\sigma^{Econ.} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^{Cult.} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Here the scale parameters come from a Cauchy distribution with a scale
parameter equal to 2.5, and the correlation matrix comes from a LKJ
distribution with parameter 4.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
n_sims <- 1e6
a <- rcauchy(n_sims, location = 0, scale = 1)
a2 <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 1)
b <- rnorm(n_sims, mean = 0, sd = 4)
mean(abs(a) > abs(b))
mean(abs(a2) > abs(b))
```

Now consider the shifts between 2023 and 2024. These shifts could be
positive or negative, and we do not know in advance how large they
will be. We therefore draw shifts from a normal distribution centred
at zero but with an estimated standard deviation. We place a prior on
this standard deviation, $\operatorname{Exponential}(10)$. This prior
has a 95% credible interval running from 0.003 units to 0.385
units. This prior is therefore (just) consistent with shifts 


of one MP who *in fact* has the same position as another MP being
described as being much more right-wing

This prior is chosen so that it assigns very low probability to
the initial cutpoint being positive. The initial cutpoint would only
need to be positive if respondents were systematically choosing the
first response option that they saw, such that it took a big
difference to get past the first cutpoint and say that the first-named
MP was only somewhat more right-wing. 

The two spacing parameters $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ were assigned
standard half-normal priors (i.e., a normal distribution truncated so
that all values are positive). The prior on the first spacing
parameter implies that when $mu_i > 0$ the respondent is *more likely
than not* to say that the first-named MP is either somewhat or much
more right-wing than the second-named MP.

The party fixed effects on both the economic and cultural dimension
are drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of 2.5. This weakly informative prior is chosen so
that the...
